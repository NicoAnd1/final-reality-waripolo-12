Context
-------

This project's goal is to create a (simplified) clone of _Final Fantasy_'s combat, a game developed
by [_Square Enix_](https://www.square-enix.com)
Broadly speaking for the combat the player has a group of characters to control and a group of 
enemies controlled by the computer.

---

**Instructions**
----------------
The programm will compile, but it will only check the tests provided in itself, therefore, there is no
instructions to run the programm.

**Considerations**
------------------
For now, there was not considered the restrictions about the kind of weapon that the differents classes
of characters can equip, also, there was not considered any type of magic in this programm and neither
any type of adverse effect.

**Logic**
---------
In this programm is a class for the characters than the player can controll, the characters have 
parameters than indicates their names, their turn in the queue and their class of character, also there is 
a method to equip a weapon to the character; there is another class for the enemy that will be controlled
by the CPU, this has parameters of name, weight and its turn in the queue, but there is no method to equip
a weapon, because this will be settle by default, and there is a package for the types of weapons of the
game, this classes have parameters of name, damage and weight.
